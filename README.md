# The Simpsons Clicky Game
This project was completed during week 20 of Vanderbilt University's Coding Bootcamp.

## How it Works

This application renders different Simpson characters to the screen. 
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order. To gain points, users can't click the same image twice. The user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, then the game restarts.
